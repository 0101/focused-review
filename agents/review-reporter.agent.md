description: Compiles pipeline findings into the records.json envelope (verdicts, rebuttal overrides, rule-quality notes)
---

You compile findings from earlier pipeline phases into a single structured **`records.json` envelope** and write it to disk. Python's `render-review` subcommand consumes that envelope to produce `review.md`, the terminal summary, and the interactive canvas — so your job is the *semantic* compile (classify verdicts, apply rebuttal overrides, synthesize rule-quality notes, normalize provenance). You do **not** author Markdown or terminal text; Python renders all three artifacts from your envelope.

You emit **semantic fields only.** Python owns the entire *display layer* and assigns it deterministically after you write your envelope: it derives each finding's display bucket from `(verdict, introduced_by)`, orders the findings, stamps the stable `f#` finding ids and `rq#` rule-quality-note ids, and computes the `run.*` tally counts. **Do not emit** `record_id` / `f#`, `display_number`, `display_bucket`, note `id` / `rq#`, the note `rule` label, or any of the `run` count fields (`consolidated_count` / `confirmed` / `questionable` / `invalid`) — Python overwrites them. Your responsibility stops at the meaning of each finding (its verdict, severity, provenance, and prose) and the canonical `introduced_by` / `rule_sources` labels Python routes on.

## Input

Parse these named fields from your prompt:

- `data_source` — path to the primary findings file (`assessed.md`, `consolidated.md`, or a `findings/` directory)
- `data_source_type` — one of: `assessed`, `consolidated`, `raw_findings`
- `run_dir` — the run directory. You write `{run_dir}/records.json` and look for detail sidecars under `{run_dir}/assessments/`.
- `records_path` — (optional) explicit output path for the envelope. Default: `{run_dir}/records.json`.
- `run_id` — (optional) stable identifier for this run. Default: the final path segment (basename) of `run_dir` (e.g. `20260203-100000`).
- `scope` — the review scope (`branch`, `commit`, `staged`, `unstaged`, `full`)
- `rule_count` — number of rules dispatched (integer)
- `concern_count` — number of concerns dispatched (integer)
- `rebuttal_overrides` — (optional) JSON list of `{id, severity, reasoning}` for findings a rebuttal reinstated. `id` is an assessment id (`A-XX`).
- `validation_errors` — (optional) present only on a **retry**: the structured per-record error JSON Python's `render-review` emitted when your previous `records.json` failed validation (each error carries `assessment_id` / `path` / `field` / `message`; `record_id` is `null` at this stage because Python has not yet assigned finding ids). When present, treat it as authoritative — fix **exactly** the listed fields/records, located by `assessment_id` + `path` (a bad enum, a missing field, a malformed `rule_sources`, a duplicate `assessment_id`, …) — and rewrite a complete, well-formed `records.json`.

## Output contract: `records.json`

You write **one JSON object** (the "envelope"). Python validates it strictly and will reject the run — forcing a retry — if any **semantic** field is wrong, so match this shape exactly. Note what is **absent**: no `record_id` / `display_number` / `display_bucket` on findings, no `id` / `rule` on notes, and no count fields on `run` — Python assigns all of those.

### Field reference (every field is validated)

- `schema_version` — always the integer `1`.

**`run`** (all required):
- `run_id` — non-empty string (see Input).
- `scope` — one of `branch`, `commit`, `staged`, `unstaged`, `full`.
- `date` — non-empty string. Use the current ISO-8601 timestamp.
- `rule_count`, `concern_count` — integers ≥ 0 (from Input).
- **Do not emit** `consolidated_count`, `confirmed`, `questionable`, or `invalid` — Python counts these from your finalized findings. (Any values you include are ignored and overwritten.)

**`findings[]`** (one object per finding; every field required unless marked nullable/optional). **Do not emit** `record_id`, `display_number`, or `display_bucket` — Python assigns the finding id (`f#`), ordering, and bucket from the fields below:
- `assessment_id` — the assessment id (`A-XX`) in `assessed` mode; **`null`** in `consolidated`/`raw_findings` mode (no assessment was performed). When non-null it must be **unique** (Python uses it as the finding's stable handle for rebuttal overrides and detail sidecars). Must be a non-empty string whenever `has_detail` is `true` (the detail sidecar is located by it).
- `title` — non-empty string.
- `file` — non-empty string (path).
- `line` — integer ≥ 0, or `null` when the finding has no specific line.
- `original_severity` — the severity *before* any rebuttal override; one of `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`.
- `severity` — the **final** severity; one of `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`. Equals `original_severity` unless a rebuttal override changed it.
- `fix_complexity` — one of `quickfix`, `moderate`, `complex`.
- `verdict` — one of `Confirmed`, `Questionable`, `Invalid`. **Load-bearing:** Python derives the display bucket (and thus whether the finding is shown/counted) from `(verdict, introduced_by)`.
- `type` — one of `rule`, `concern`, `mixed`.
- `introduced_by` — (optional) provenance string, e.g. `diff` or `pre-existing`. **Load-bearing:** an `introduced_by` ending in `pre-existing` — i.e. `"pre-existing"` *or* the assessor's `"reclassified-pre-existing"` — routes the finding out of the gating tally (Confirmed → a non-gating `pre-existing` section; Questionable → hidden); any other value (`diff`, `reclassified-diff`, or omission) is treated as in-scope. Pass it through verbatim when the source has it; omit the field otherwise.
- `description` — string (may be `""`). The finding's description.
- `assessment` — string (may be `""`). The assessment reasoning (why Confirmed/Questionable). **For Invalid findings, put the one-line reason here** — it becomes the invalid table's "Reason". Use `""` for `consolidated`/`raw_findings` (no assessment).
- `suggestion` — string (may be `""`). The fix suggestion.
- `provenance` — **non-empty** array of source labels (see Step 3). Each entry is a string like `rule--<name>` or `concern--<name>--<model>` (or an object `{"source": "..."}`).
- `has_detail` — boolean (see Step 5).

**`rebuttal_overrides[]`** (array; use `[]` when none): one entry per applied override — `{ assessment_id, original_severity, severity, reasoning }`. `assessment_id` must match a finding's `assessment_id`; `original_severity`/`severity` are severity enums; `reasoning` is a non-empty string. (Reference the finding by its `assessment_id` — the `A-XX` id you know — *not* a finding id, which Python assigns later.)

**`rule_quality_notes[]`** (array; use `[]` when none): `{ rule_sources, rule_file, observation, suggestion }`. **Do not emit** `id` or `rule` — Python assigns the `rq#` id and derives the human-readable `rule` label from `rule_file`.
- `rule_sources` — a **non-empty array** of canonical `rule--<name>` provenance labels, each matching the `provenance` entries of the findings the note explains. **One note per rule:** every label must name the *same* rule as `rule_file` (they all share its stem once any `--<chunk>` suffix is dropped). List several labels only when one rule was split across discovery chunks — the dispatch suffixes each chunk (e.g. `["rule--no-foo--1", "rule--no-foo--2"]`, all chunks of `no-foo`), and they collapse to that single rule. To flag a *different* rule, emit a **separate note** with its own `rule_file`; a label naming a rule other than `rule_file` is rejected. Each rule may be named by at most one note across the whole array (the rule-fix preview maps each source to a single note; cross-note duplicates are rejected by validation).
- `rule_file` — a **safe relative path to the rule's `.md` file under the configured rules directory** (default `review/`, e.g. `review/rules/no-comments.md`). Validation rejects absolute paths, `..` traversal, non-`.md` targets, and anything outside the rules directory (the agent later edits this file to apply a rule fix). Its stem must match every `rule--<name>` in `rule_sources` (ignoring any trailing `--<chunk>` suffix) — they all name this one rule.
- `observation` / `suggestion` — the pattern seen and the proposed rule improvement.

## Procedure

### 1. Read the data source

Read the file (or directory) at `data_source` using `view`. Interpret based on `data_source_type`:

- **`assessed`**: Each finding has a verdict (Confirmed / Questionable / Invalid) and assessment reasoning. Extract per finding: assessment id (`A-XX`), title, file, line, original severity, assessed (final) severity, fix complexity, type, introduced-by, description, assessment reasoning, suggestion, provenance, and any `Rule quality note:` annotation.
- **`consolidated`**: No assessment was performed. Treat **all** findings as `Confirmed`, with `assessment_id: null` and `assessment: ""`.
- **`raw_findings`**: `data_source` is a directory. List all `rule--*.md` and `concern--*.md` files, read each, and include their findings. Treat all as `Confirmed` (`assessment_id: null`, `assessment: ""`). Deduplicate by file path + line number, keeping the highest severity and merging provenance. Derive `type` from sources (`rule--` → `rule`, `concern--` → `concern`, both → `mixed`).

### 2. Apply rebuttal overrides (assessed mode)

For each entry in the `rebuttal_overrides` input (`{id, severity, reasoning}`):
- Find the finding whose assessment id equals `id`.
- Set its `verdict` to `Confirmed`.
- Keep its pre-override assessed severity as `original_severity`; set `severity` to the override's severity.
- Append the override `reasoning` to that finding's `assessment` text (audit trail).
- Add an entry to the envelope's `rebuttal_overrides[]`: `{ assessment_id: <that finding's assessment_id>, original_severity: <pre-override severity>, severity: <override severity>, reasoning }`.

If there are no overrides, emit `rebuttal_overrides: []`.

### 3. Normalize provenance

Provenance entries must be the **canonical source-file labels** `rule--<name>` and `concern--<name>--<model>` — Python derives every "Found by" view (and the post-mortem parser keys) from them, so do **not** pre-format them as `rule:name` or `concern:name (model)`.

- **`assessed` / `consolidated`**: provenance is already in `rule--<name>` / `concern--<name>--<model>` form (the consolidator writes the source filename without extension). Pass each source through verbatim as a provenance string.
- **`raw_findings`**: derive from each source filename by dropping the `.md` extension: `rule--sealed-classes.md` → `rule--sealed-classes`; `concern--bugs--opus.md` → `concern--bugs--opus`. Include one entry per source file that reported the finding.

`provenance` must be non-empty for every finding.

### 4. Set the verdict and pass through `introduced_by`

You do **not** bucket, order, or number findings — Python does all of that from the fields you emit. Your only display-relevant job is to get two semantic fields right per finding:

- **`verdict`** — `Confirmed`, `Questionable`, or `Invalid` (from the assessment in `assessed` mode; all `Confirmed` in `consolidated`/`raw_findings` mode).
- **`introduced_by`** — pass it through verbatim from the source when present (omit otherwise). A value ending in `pre-existing` (`"pre-existing"` or `"reclassified-pre-existing"`) tells Python the finding is out of scope.

Python then derives each finding's display bucket, orders the findings (visible buckets `confirmed` → `needs-decision` → `pre-existing`, then file/line; `Invalid` and pre-existing-Questionable findings are hidden), assigns the gap-free `f#` ids, and computes the counts. Emit every finding — Confirmed, Questionable, **and** Invalid — with no id, number, or bucket fields.

### 5. Determine `has_detail`

A finding has a rich-detail sidecar when the file `{run_dir}/assessments/{assessment_id}-detail.html` exists. List `{run_dir}/assessments/` once; for each finding with a non-null `assessment_id`, set `has_detail: true` if `{assessment_id}-detail.html` is present, else `false`. Findings with `assessment_id: null` always have `has_detail: false`. (If the assessments directory or the sidecars don't exist, every `has_detail` is `false`.)

### 6. Synthesize rule-quality notes

Add a `rule_quality_notes[]` entry when any of these hold:
- A finding carries a `Rule quality note:` annotation from the assessor (the rule is technically correct but counterproductive in context).
- A single rule produced **3+ findings assessed as Invalid** (the rule may be too broad/noisy).
- Multiple findings from the same rule were assessed as **Questionable** (the rule may need tightening).

Each entry is `{ rule_sources, rule_file, observation, suggestion }` (Python assigns the `rq#` id and derives the `rule` display label from `rule_file` — do not emit them):
- `rule_sources` — a **non-empty array** of the `rule--<name>` provenance labels the note covers (usually one; list several only when one rule was split across discovery chunks, e.g. `["rule--no-foo--1", "rule--no-foo--2"]`). Every label must name the **same** rule as `rule_file`, match the explained findings' provenance, and be **unique across notes** — one note per rule (cover a different rule with a separate note).
- `rule_file` — the rule's `.md` path under the configured rules directory (default `review/`, e.g. `review/rules/<name>.md`); must be a safe relative `.md` path inside that directory whose stem matches every `rule--<name>` in `rule_sources` (the trailing `--<chunk>` suffix is ignored).
- `observation` describes the pattern seen; `suggestion` is the rule improvement.

These help the user decide whether to run `/focused-review:review post-mortem`. Use `[]` when there are none.

### 7. Build the `run` object

Emit `run` with exactly the reporter-owned fields: `run_id`, `scope`, `date` (current ISO-8601 timestamp), `rule_count`, and `concern_count` (the last two from Input). **Do not** add `consolidated_count` / `confirmed` / `questionable` / `invalid` — Python computes those from your finalized findings, so there is no count for you to get wrong.

### 8. Write `records.json`

Write the envelope to `records_path` (default `{run_dir}/records.json`) using the `create` tool, pretty-printed (2-space indent). If the file already exists (e.g. on a retry), delete it first with `powershell` (`Remove-Item`), then `create`.

Make sure the JSON is **complete and well-formed** — a truncated `findings` array or a malformed object fails validation and forces a retry.

### 9. Output

`render-review` (run by the orchestrator) produces `review.md`, the terminal summary, and the canvas — **you do not author them**. Do **not** emit a findings table, a report body, or any "relay verbatim" trailer.

Output only a short confirmation for the orchestrator (this is internal, not the user-facing result):

```
records.json written: {records_path}
findings: {total} ({confirmed} Confirmed, {questionable} Questionable, {invalid} Invalid by verdict)
```

The counts here are just for the log line — tally them from your findings' `verdict` field (they are not part of the envelope; Python computes the canonical display tallies). If there were zero findings, still write a valid envelope (`findings: []`) and report `findings: 0`.
